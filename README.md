# Substance problem among users from a dating site

Exploratory analysis of substance abuse among users using Python and the OkCupid dataset.

Substance abuse has a cure, but for obvious reasons, most people are too ashamed to reach out for help and this makes the problem even harder to address. What if we could tell whether someone has a potential problem with drugs without asking them explicitly?

This study tries to answer the following questions:

- Which age group shows the largest share of people with a possible substance problem? And which gender?
- Which kind of professional is more vulnerable to substance abuse?
- Are people with kids or partners less likely to have a substance problem?
- Are religious people less likely to have a substance problem?
- Does making healthy choices (e.g., not smoking or eating plant-based diets) correlate negatively with substance abuse?

And last but not least, how accurately can we predict substance abuse with just this bunch of information?

Please read my [blog post](https://brunoarine.com/blog/the-most-common-traits-of-substance-abuse/) about it, or take a look at the Jupyter notebook for all technical details.
